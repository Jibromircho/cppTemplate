# C++ Project Template

This is my template for C++ projects on VSCode.

- A basic C++ program with multiple source files and a header file.
- Pre-configured tasks for building with `g++` including include directories and library paths.
- Pre-configured launch settings for debugging with `gdb`.

## Directory Structure

- `include/`: Header files
- `lib/`: Static or dynamic libraries
- `src/`: Source files
- `bin/`: Output directory for binaries (create this directory if it does not exist)
- `third_party/`: Third party files
- `build/`: CMake build folder
